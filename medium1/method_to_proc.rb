In our Ruby course content on blocks, we learn about "symbol to proc" and how it works. To 
review briefly, consider this code:
=end

# comparator = proc { |a, b| b <=> a }
# and the Array#sort method, which expects a block argument to express how the Array will be sorted. If we want to use comparator to sort the Array, we have a problem: it is a proc, not a block. The following code:


# array.sort(comparator)
# fails with an ArgumentError. To get around this, we can use the proc to block operator & 
# to convert comparator to a block:

# array.sort(&comparator)
# This now works as expected, and we sort the Array in reverse order.

# When applied to an argument object for a method, a lone & causes ruby to try to convert that 
# object to a block. If that object is a proc, the conversion happens automatically, just as 
# shown above. If the object is not a proc, then & attempts to call the #to_proc method on 
# the object first. Used with symbols, e.g., &:to_s, Ruby creates a proc that calls the 
# #to_s method on a passed object, and then converts that proc to a block. This is the 
# "symbol to proc" operation (though perhaps it should be called "symbol to block").

# Note that &, when applied to an argument object is not the same as an & applied to a
# method parameter, as in this code:


# def foo(&block)
#   block.call
# end

# While & applied to an argument object causes the object to be converted to a block, & applied 
# to a method parameter causes the associated block to be converted to a proc. 
# In essence, the two uses of & are opposites.

# Did you know that you can perform a similar trick with methods? You can apply the & 
# operator to an object of the Method class, which is created by Object#method. 
# In doing so, Ruby can call Method#to_proc.

# Using this information, together with the course page linked above, fill in the 
# missing part of the following code so we can convert an array of integers to base 
# 8 (octal numbers). Use the comments for help in determining where to make your 
# modifications, and make sure to review the "Approach/Algorithm" section for this exercise; 
# it should prove useful.


# Replace the two `method_name` placeholders with actual method calls
def convert_to_base_8(n)
  n.to_s(8).to_i
end

# Replace `argument` with the correct argument below
# `method` is `Object#method`, not a placeholder
base8_proc = method(:convert_to_base_8).to_proc

# We'll need a Proc object to make this code work
# Replace `a_proc` with the correct object
p [8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 33].map(&base8_proc)
# The expected return value of map on this number array should be:


# [10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 41]
# You don't need a deep understanding of octal numbers -- base 8 -- for this problem. 
# It's enough to know that octal numbers use the digits 0-7 only, much as decimal numbers use 
# the digits 0-9. Thus, the octal number 10 is equivalent to the decimal number 8, octal 20 is 
# the same as decimal 16, octal 100 is the same as decimal 64, and so on. No math is needed 
# for this problem though; see the Approach/Algorithm section for some hints.

# Approach/Algorithm
# To solve this problem you'll need to do a bit of research. Refer to this page on the 
# Integer class instance method, to_s. You will also have to use one method from the Object 
# class. For that, check out this documentation page.

# NOTE: This exercise is tricky. If you can't finish it, feel free to follow along with the 
# solution; it may be treated as a learning experience rather than something you should be 
# able to figure out on your own.
