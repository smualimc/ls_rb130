Meetups are a great way to meet people who share a common interest. Typically, 
meetups happen monthly on the same day of the week. For example, a meetup's 
meeting may be set as:

The first Monday of January 2021
The third Tuesday of December 2020
The tenth Wednesday of December 2020
The last Thursday of January 2021
In this program, we'll construct objects that represent a meetup date. Each 
object takes a month number (1-12) and a year (e.g., 2021). Your object should 
be able to determine the exact date of the meeting in the specified month and year. 
For instance, if you ask for the 2nd Wednesday of May 2021, the object should be 
able to determine that the meetup for that month will occur on the 12th of May, 2021.

The descriptors that may be given are strings: 'first', 'second', 'third', 'fourth', 'fifth', 'last', and 'teenth'. 
The case of the strings is not important; that is, 'first' and 'fIrSt' are equivalent. 
Note that "teenth" is a made up word. There was a meetup whose members realised that there are exactly 7 days 
that end in '-teenth'. Therefore, it's guaranteed that each day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, ...) 
will have exactly one date that is the "teenth" of that day in every month. That is, every month has exactly one 
"teenth" Monday, one "teenth" Tuesday, etc. The fifth day of the month may not happen every month, but some meetup 
groups like that irregularity.

The days of the week are given by the strings 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 
and 'Sunday'. Again, the case of the strings is not important.

--Program requirements/rules--
The objects represent a meetup date
descriptors are: 'first', 'second', 'third', 'fourth', 'fifth', 'last', and 'teenth'. *case insensitive*
teenth represents any of the 7 days from 13-19, so each weekday has its teenth
the fifth day of the month for some weekdays don't exist depending on the month
Weekdays are *case insensitive*
If, for a given year and month, the weekday doesn't exist for the descriptor, return nil 

--Examples parse--
#initialize(year, month): the instance variables of each object are @year and @month

#day(weekday, descriptor): using @year, @month, weekday and descriptor return the meetup date as yyyy, mm, dd

--Data structure--
a hash weekday_values to add the corresponding days of the month from sunday to saturday

        1 => [],
